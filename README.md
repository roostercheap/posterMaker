1. Effectively use Svelte's components and routing mechanisms to document your various JavaScript/TypeScript skills.
   -in (src/routes/) I have various svelte files and js expressed in them
   -in (src/routes/api) various examples of ts used to make the api work
2. Properly organize your code using at least 3 custom components and 5 functional SvelteKit routes.
   -my routes are in (src/routes/) and I have 2 buttons in my main +page.svelte (line 9-39[script] and 116/117[html])
3. Work with command-line tools, Git, and NPM to create and manage your project within a real development toolset and history of consistent Git commits.
   -type: "git log" into terminal, I have also used npm run build and npm run dev
4. Demonstrate multiple examples of captured user events (click, mouse over, etc.) that cause some action to occur.
   -Again main page has button, as well as all the other pages, except for my "favorites page"
5. Provide at least 5 examples of data bound to UI elements.
6. Provide at least 2 examples of utilizing functions that structure and reshape JSON data retrieved for external sources.
   -in (src/routes/api/sQ) I can get, post, and delete from my sQ.json located (src/data/)
   -just an update, I switched it to be saved to mongoDB so the OG .json is still there but it is unused
7. Connect to at least 1 outside API using a mix of SvelteKit loading functions and display retrieved data in your UI.
    -I use to outside APIs, one from API ninjas (random quotes) and the other from Unsplash (random images) --THE UNSPLASH IS A DEMO IT WILL ONLY PRODUCE 50 PICs before crapping out--
8. Structure, document, and deploy your final project code according to common industry practices.
   -I tried my best to use good file structure and add notes
9. Design and Develop the major features of your app as uniquely your own
    -I definitely had help but MOSTLY with errors and I pulled from old projects as well
10. Ensure your app functions properly without errors and exhibits good UI/UX design.
    -Yes...Just don't button mash

    PLEASE DO NOT SPAM THE AI OR GENERATE BUTTON, THERE ARE LIMITED TOKENS FOR THESE THINGS!!!
